Multiplex based DDoS flooder with socks5


I may update this soon to work with more proxy support and TLS.

You are responsible for how you execute this script.


# Installation
git clone https://github.com/ChandlerAx/MultiplexDDoS.git <br>
cd MultiplexDDoS <br>
python3 worker.py <br>

You may need install the asked modules and if you use python2 use python worker.py, make sure to update the socks5 (most are dead)
